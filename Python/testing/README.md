## Manual Testing vs Automated Testing

Automatic the process of checking if the return value matches expactations.
(Write code to test code)

**Test Cases** 
What happens with 1..n elements, characters, etc..
The more test cases the better

Unit Test

Tests should never modify a production environment.
